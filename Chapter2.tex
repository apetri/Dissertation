In this Chapter we review the basics of the Gravitational Lensing (GL) effect. GL is a prediction of General Relativity and states that light rays that travel through space--time inhomogeneities experience trajectory deflections. We start by deriving an equation for the light ray geodesics in a non homogeneous background, following the derivation in \citep{Dodelson-C11}. We then specialize the geodesic solution to the Weak Lensing (WL) case, exploring approximate approaches such as the Born approximation. We conclude discussing the short comings of these approximate approaches for modeling of WL observations. 

\section{Light ray geodesics}

\subsection{Geodesic equation}
Scalar perturbations to the FRW metric in (\ref{eq:1:frw}) can be parametrized in the conformal Newtonian gauge by two scalar potentials $\Phi,\Psi$ as follows

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2:confnewt}
ds^2 = -c^2dt^2(1+2\Psi(\bb{x},t)) + a^2d\bb{x}^2(1+2\Phi(\bb{x},t))
\end{equation}
%
For the scope of the present work we can safely ignore vector and tensor perturbations to the FRW metric as their effects are negligible in WL observations. We parametrize a light ray space--time trajectory $x^\mu(\tau)$ in terms of a continuous real parameter $\tau$, which plays the same role as proper time for massive particles. The geodesic equation reads 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2:geodesic}
\frac{d^2 x^\mu(\tau)}{d\tau^2} = \Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^\mu(x^\mu(\tau)) \frac{d x^\alpha(\tau)}{d\tau}\frac{d x^\beta(\tau)}{d\tau}
\end{equation}
%
Where the affine connection $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^\mu$ for the metric (\ref{eq:2:confnewt}) is, at first order in the potentials

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2:connection}
\begin{matrix}
\Gamma_{00}^0 = \frac{1}{c}\partial_t\Psi & ; & \Gamma_{0i}^0=\Gamma_{i0}^0 = \partial_i\Psi \\  
\Gamma_{ij}^0 = \frac{\delta_{ij}a^2}{c}(H+2H(\Phi-\Psi)+\partial_t\Phi) & ; & \Gamma_{00}^i = \frac{\partial_i \Psi}{a^2} \\
\Gamma^i_{j0} = \Gamma^i_{0j} = \frac{\delta_{ij}}{c}(H+\partial_t\Phi) & ; & \Gamma_{jk}^i = (\delta_{ij}\partial_k+\delta_{ik}\partial_j-\delta_{jk}\partial_i)\Phi\\
\end{matrix}
\end{equation}
%
Where the space--time dependency of the quantities has been omitted for notational simplicity. For the sake of expressing WL observables at first order in the potentials $\Phi,\Psi$, it is sufficient to approximate the affine connection at first order. We will make an argument later in the Chapter for higher order post--Newtonian (PN) corrections to be negligible for the scope of this work, following the conclusions of \citep{PNLensing}. We introduce a system of coordinates centered on a fundamental observer on Earth, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:2:scheme}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2:coord}
x^{\mu} = (ct,\chi,\xp)
\end{equation}
%
Where we indicated the transverse coordinates (with respect of the observer) corresponding to an angle on the sky $\pt$ as $\xp=\chi\pt$. We will adopt the so called flat sky approximation, in which the angles $\pt$ are small.

Since photons travel along null geodesics, their 4-momentum $P^\mu=dx^\mu/d\tau=(p^0,\bb{p})$ must satisfy $g_{\mu\nu}P^{\mu}P^{\nu}=0$, which gives the constraint (at first order in $\Psi$)

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2:nullconstr}
p^0 = c\frac{dt}{d\tau} = p(1-\Psi)
\end{equation} 
%
with $p=\vert\bb{p}\vert$. Using the fact that $d\chi/dt = -c/a$, we can replace the $\tau$ derivatives in (\ref{eq:2:geodesic}) with $\chi$ derivatives using the prescription
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2:tau2chi}
\frac{d}{d\tau} = \frac{dt}{d\tau}\frac{d\chi}{dt}\frac{d}{d\chi} = -\frac{p(1-\Psi)}{a}\frac{d}{d\chi}
\end{equation}
%
If we focus on the transverse components, the LHS of (\ref{eq:2:geodesic}) looks like
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2:geodesic-lhs-1}
\frac{d^2\xp}{d\tau^2} = \frac{p}{a}\frac{d}{d\chi}\left(\frac{p}{a}\frac{d\xp}{d\chi}\right)
\end{equation}
%
Following \citep{Dodelson-C11}, we dropped small terms of order $\Psi d\xp$. At dominant order the photon momentum $a$ redshifts as $1/a$, and hence we can pull the product $pa$ out of the differentiation, obtaining 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2:geodesic-lhs-2}
\frac{d^2\xp}{d\tau^2} = p^2\frac{d}{d\chi}\left(\frac{1}{a^2}\frac{d\xp}{d\chi}\right)
\end{equation}
%
Now we can focus on the RHS of (\ref{eq:2:geodesic}) which reads, in the transverse components
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2:geodesic-rhs-1}
\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^i \frac{d x^\alpha}{d\tau}\frac{d x^\beta}{d\tau} = \frac{p^2}{a^2} \Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^i \frac{d x^\alpha}{d\chi}\frac{d x^\beta}{d\chi}
\end{equation}
%
If we expand the products in (\ref{eq:2:geodesic-rhs-1}) using the affine connection (\ref{eq:2:connection}) at first order in the potentials, we obtain
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2:geodesic-rhs-2}
\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^i \frac{d x^\alpha}{d\tau}\frac{d x^\beta}{d\tau} = \frac{p^2}{a^2}\left[\partial_i\Psi-\frac{2aH}{c}\frac{d\xp}{d\chi} -\partial_i\Phi \right]
\end{equation}
%
The complete geodesic equation now becomes 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2:geodesic-fo-1}
\frac{d}{d\chi}\left(\frac{1}{a^2}\frac{d\xp}{d\chi}\right) = \frac{1}{a^2}\left[\nabla_\perp(\Psi-\Phi)-\frac{2aH}{c}\frac{d\xp}{d\chi}\right]
\end{equation}
%
After a few simplifications this assumes the form 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2:geodesic-fo-2}
\frac{d^2\xp(\chi)}{d\chi^2} = -\nabla_\perp(\Phi(\chi,\xp)-\Psi(\chi,\xp))
\end{equation}

\subsection{Einstein equation}
The potentials $\Phi,\Psi$, as they appear in the metric (\ref{eq:2:confnewt}), must satisfy Einstein equation. Since we limit our study to scalar perturbations, there are only two independent components of the Einstein equation that we need to consider. Since WL physics is dominated by the late time behavior of density perturbations, we will ignore relativistic particles as contribution to the energy momentum tensor and focus on cold matter only. We parametrize the matter density as 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2:matterrho}
\rho_m(\bb{x},t) = \rho_m(t)(1+\delta(\bb{x},t))
\end{equation}
%
where $\rho_m(t)$ is the spatially averaged matter density and $\delta(\bb{x},t)$ is the spatially dependent density contrast. With this notation, the two independent components of the linearized Einstein's equation become

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2:einstein-00}
\nabla^2\Phi +3\frac{a^2H^2\Psi-a^2H\partial_t\Phi}{c^2} = -4\pi G\rho_m\delta
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2:einstein-ij}
\nabla^2(\Phi+\Psi) = 0
\end{equation}
%
A few considerations are in order here. First of all, the terms in (\ref{eq:2:einstein-00}) which contain powers of $aH$ are sub--dominant for the WL case of interest, as the laplacian term will always dominate for modes with wavenumber $k$ well inside the Hubble horizon $kc\gg aH$. We can hence drop these terms from (\ref{eq:2:einstein-00}), which then reduces to a Poisson--like equation. Equation (\ref{eq:2:einstein-ij}) comes from the traceless part of the spatial Einstein equation, and as such it is sourced by anisotropic stresses in the matter components. Because such stresses are proportional to the quadrupole of the distributions in momentum, which are negligible for non relativistic species, they can be safely neglected when studying WL. We will then use (\ref{eq:2:einstein-ij}) to conclude $\Psi=-\Phi$ and express the geodesic equation in terms of the single gravitational potential $\Phi$

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2:geodesic-fo-3}
\frac{d^2\xp(\chi)}{d\chi^2} = -2\nabla_\perp\Phi(\chi,\xp(\chi))
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2:poisson}
\nabla^2\Phi(\chi,\xp) = -4\pi G\rho_m(\chi)\delta(\chi,\xp)
\end{equation}  
%
We substituted the time dependency with $\chi$ dependencies using the distance--redshift relation. 

\subsection{Solution to the geodesic equation}
The geodesic equation (\ref{eq:2:geodesic-fo-3}) is a second order differential equation which can be solved exactly once suitable initial conditions are specified. If we indicate with $\pt$ the angular position of the light ray as it is received by the observer we have $\xp(0)=0$ and $d\xp /d\chi(0)=\pt$. Equation (\ref{eq:2:geodesic-fo-3}) can hence be solved by double integration

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2:geosol-1}
\xp(\chi,\pt) = \chi\pt - 2\int_0^\chi d\chi'\int_0^{\chi'}d\chi'' \nabla_\perp\Phi(\chi,\xp(\chi'',\pt))
\end{equation} 
%
Note that we can exchange the order of the integration in $\chi'$ and $\chi''$ by taking advantage of the triangular shape of the integration domain, and perform one of the integrations analytically to get

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2:geosol-2}
\xp(\chi,\pt) = \chi\pt - 2\int_0^\chi d\chi'(\chi-\chi')\nabla_\perp\Phi(\chi,\xp(\chi',\pt))
\end{equation} 
%
We expressed the solution (\ref{eq:2:geosol-2}) to (\ref{eq:2:geodesic-fo-3}) in implicit form, as the RHS contains $\xp(\chi,\pt)$ itself. An implicit expression like (\ref{eq:2:geosol-2}) however, present some advantages: first of all, in order to express the solution at some $\chi_s$, we only need to know $\xp$ for $\chi<\chi_s$, making (\ref{eq:2:geosol-2}) solvable numerically via dynamic programming. Moreover, because the potential $\Phi$ appears in the RHS, in the limit in which $\Phi$ is small, the solution in implicit form suggest a straightforward perturbative approximation in powers of $\Phi$, which will be explored later in the Chapter. In the next section, we connect the light ray geodesic (\ref{eq:2:geosol-2}) to the main WL observables.
