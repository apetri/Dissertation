	At the end of this wonderful 6 years journey, during which I learned a lot, I want to thank my advisors Zolt\'{a}n and Morgan for guiding me along the road. I also want to thank my fianc\'e Mary and my parents Marco and Eva for continued, invaluable and unconditioned support. 

	I deeply believe that science is a mean for peace, and I hope that looking at the stars will give us the inspiration we need to face the many challenges that lie ahead, today especially. 

	The Ancients launched the Destiny to investigate a coherent structure in the CMB, which they believed to be a hint of an intelligence greater than humans could comprehend. As Dr. Rush rightfully stated, ``the mission was never about going home, but it's about getting us to where we're going''. \\ \\
	That is \\
	the mission.
